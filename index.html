    <h1>hello</h1>

    to make changes or modify repo from the github 
    in vs code terminal type
    git clone <link of the repo (click on code<> of repo and copy https link )>

    git status 
     allows us to see status of file like tracked or unmodifed or modified or stged 
    git add or git add . (first wehave to add files so it goes to staged state)

    git commit -m "message of modifiacations"
     after adding use this command to commit 
    git push origin main
     used to push your code to repo 

    if you have to make repo from vscode
     make a folder 
     create readme.,md and oher files you want to add to repo
     git init 
     to add ourproject to gihub repo

     then run status add staus commit

     then use 
     git remote add origin (link of https)
     git status
     git branch (bydefault main) if we want to change git branch -M name(main,master)
     git push origin main
